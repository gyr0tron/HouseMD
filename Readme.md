<h3>A conscious house powered by blockchain</h3>
</div>

----------------------------------
## Idea

* Our self-conscious house runs in the background while we are off to work, enjoying our free time elsewhere or even living in it.
* A building which is imposing by its complex system (blockchain with smart contracts and AI in the future) for maintaining and improving its state, that runs in the background and is activated by certain events (new regulations, subsidies, â€¦) by which it is self-conscious. 
* It solves problems relating to monthly recurring payments, tracking the lifecycle of the house, it's buying history, legal documents, optimizing resources, automating maintainance decisions, constantly learning.
